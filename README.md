# Technical-Indicators
In this project I have implemented three technical indicators Moving Average Convergence Divergence(MACD), CAF(Chaikins Money flow) and RSI(Relative Strength Index) in R for a portfolio of ten stocks during a period of one year from 14/02/18 to 14/02/19, to get each day signal to buy/sell/hold on each stock in our portfolio.
